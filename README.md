# Open_Source_Software_Git

In a simulated academic environment, our project mirrored real-world scenarios where companies transitioned from their current version control system to Git. We simulated practices reflective of real-world agile methodologies by orchestrating the creation of user stories, guiding daily Scrum meetings, overseeing bug resolution, and orchestrating release planning to uphold project excellence.
